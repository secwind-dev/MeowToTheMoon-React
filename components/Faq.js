            existing on Ethereum Blockchain. We don‚Äôt promise anything that is

          <h2 className="text--4xl">Will there be a pre-sale or whitelist ?</h2>

            After researching through numerous projects, we have decided to
            create a new way of whitelist. The role @The Early Meows will serve
            as a new way of whitelist, in which they will have the access to the
            "early channel", a channel that they will be notified a hint about
            the timing of the drop. More detail can be found in discord channel

            Firstly, the artwork is cute. Secondly, with the royalties program
            and continuous giveaway activities, the project is driven to benefit

            The founders have been an investor in Crypto world for over three
            years. There were ups and downs due to high volatility of the
            market. Hence, we want to create the project where holders can
            receive passive incomes as well as a continuous benefit, ensuring
            that the holder can feel like ‚Äú I will definitely make more than
            what I pay for minting.‚Äù
